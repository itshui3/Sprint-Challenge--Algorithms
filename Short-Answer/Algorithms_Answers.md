## Exercise I

a) O(n)

If we consider that a necessarily begins at 0 in this problem, we can then refactor the logic to become: 
how many increments of n^2 does it take to reach n^3? 
and because n * n^2 = n^3, the time complexity of this problem is O(n)
It will take n amounts of n^2 increments to reach n^3
ie. if n = 3
3^2 = 9
3^3 = 27
27 / 9 = 3
